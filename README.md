# Hi, I'm Josue 👋

Civil engineer building AI systems for infrastructure intelligence.

PhD student at the National Center for Asphalt Technology (NCAT), Auburn University.

I explore how infrastructure data and engineering workflows can become structured, queryable, and AI-native.

## 🚧 What I'm Building

- AI tools for pavement and infrastructure decision workflows
- Engineering intelligence systems (OMIX)
- Predictive models for pavement performance
- AI-assisted laboratory and engineering automation

- ## 🔬 Featured Projects

### OMIX
AI-native exploration of pavement and infrastructure decision workflows.

### Pavement Performance Prediction
Mathematical models for volumetric and performance prediction based on gradation modifications.

### Engineering Workflow Prototypes
AI tools exploring automation of laboratory and engineering decisions.

## 🧠 Infrastructure Research

My doctoral research focuses on recycled binder availability (RBA) and performance-based pavement design.

This work informs my interest in building AI systems capable of reasoning about infrastructure behavior rather than only processing data.

## ⚙️ Current Focus
